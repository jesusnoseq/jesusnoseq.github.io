      <description>Request Inbox Some time ago, I created a small project to visualize callbacks and HTTP requests. I called it Request Inbox.
Objective I started working on this project with the goal of replacing webhookinbox.com, which was being used in the project I had just joined. Webhookinbox.com behaved quite erratically and was also very insecure. Among other things, all the URLs were public and there was no HTTPS.
To create a more secure and reliable application, I developed Request Inbox, and today I decided to publish the repository.</description>

      <description>My particular case I have always been a very curious person with a tendency to start different projects. It happens to me that I drop the project when it does not motivate me. If I already have the knowledge to complete the project and all that&amp;rsquo;s left is to spend hours on it, my motivation goes down.
This behavior ends up frustrating me because I want to finish projects, not leave them unfinish.</description>

      <description>When I started working and saving some money. I thought it might be a good idea to invest, I then remembered to check the fees to be paid for buying shares and discarded the option. Now it is much easier to invest and be well informed, thanks to the internet. At the beginning of 2020, I started to get interested in investing again by watching videos on YouTube. There are some really good channels, but also some that are a bit dangerous or directly looking to scam you.</description>
