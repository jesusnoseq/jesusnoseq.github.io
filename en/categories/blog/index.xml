      <description>Are videogames the cathedrals of the 21st century? For some time now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been intrigued by the scant recognition that videogames receive outside the ‘gamer’ realm. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe this lack of recognition is due to deliberate disregard, but rather a shortage of information. To help appreciate the enormous effort involved in creating a videogame, I&amp;rsquo;ve devised an analogy with something much more tangible and physical.
In this post, we will compare the estimated hours of work required to develop a videogame with those historically invested in the construction of cathedrals, skyscrapers, and pyramids.</description>

      <description>Request Inbox Some time ago, I created a small project to visualize callbacks and HTTP requests. I called it Request Inbox.
Objective I started working on this project with the goal of replacing webhookinbox.com, which was being used in the project I had just joined. Webhookinbox.com behaved quite erratically and was also very insecure. Among other things, all the URLs were public and there was no HTTPS.
To create a more secure and reliable application, I developed Request Inbox, and today I decided to publish the repository.</description>

      <description>When I started working and saving some money. I thought it might be a good idea to invest, I then remembered to check the fees to be paid for buying shares and discarded the option. Now it is much easier to invest and be well informed, thanks to the internet. At the beginning of 2020, I started to get interested in investing again by watching videos on YouTube. There are some really good channels, but also some that are a bit dangerous or directly looking to scam you.</description>
