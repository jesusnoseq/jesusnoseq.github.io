[{"content":"For some time now, I\u0026rsquo;ve been intrigued by the scant recognition that videogames receive outside the â€˜gamerâ€™ realm. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe this lack of recognition is due to deliberate disregard, but rather a shortage of information. To help appreciate the enormous effort involved in creating a videogame, I\u0026rsquo;ve devised an analogy with something much more tangible and physical.\nIn this post, we will compare the estimated hours of work required to develop a videogame with those historically invested in the construction of cathedrals, skyscrapers, and pyramids.\nBoth videogames and building constructions require multidisciplinary teams. A videogame is not just interaction: characters need to be designed, modeled, animated, and given a voice. There is also a need to tell a story, create scenarios, and dialogues, not to mention including sounds and a background soundtrack. To make everything fun and interactive, it is also necessary to design, program, and balance the mechanics. This gives us an initial idea of the different roles needed to create a videogame.\nTo illustrate this comparison, I have created a table â€”with the help of AIâ€” where we can see the duration and estimated cost of some of the most emblematic videogames and buildings.\nName Type Estimated Hours (millions) Duration (years) Estimated Total Cost (USD current) Involved People (approx.) Notes La Sagrada Familia (Basilica) Building 710 142 (1882â€“present) â‰ˆ$3,000 M 1,000 Unfinished after ~140 years; GaudÃ­\u0026rsquo;s masterpiece; annual private funding â‰ˆâ‚¬25 M. Notre-Dame Cathedral (Paris) Building 665 182 (1163â€“1345) â‰ˆ$900 M 1,000 Iconic French Gothic; restored after the 2019 fire with funds of â‰ˆ$900 M. Great Pyramid of Giza (Khufu) Building 520 20 (c. 2560 BC) â‰ˆ$300 M 7,000 Built in 20 years; was the tallest structure in the world for ~3,800 years. Sydney Opera House Building 280 14 (1959â€“1973) â‰ˆ$730 M 10,000 UNESCO World Heritage; 14 years of construction with 10,000 workers; original cost A$102 M (1973). Grand Theft Auto VI Video Game â‰ˆ48 â‰ˆ12 (2014â€“2026) â‰ˆ$2,000 M 2,000 In development (expected May 2026); budget ~US$2,000 M; development of one of the most ambitious AAA titles. Red Dead Redemption 2 Video Game 25.6 8 (2010â€“2018) â‰ˆ$500 M 1,600 8 years of development with ~1,600 people; cost $370â€“540 M (dev+marketing). Star Citizen Video Game 24 â‰ˆ12+ (2012â€“2025+) â‰ˆ$800 M 1,000 Crowdfunded +US$800 M; ongoing development; team ~1,000 devs. Burj Khalifa (Dubai) Building 22 6 (2004â€“2010) â‰ˆ$1,500 M 12,000 828 m skyscraper; 22 million man-hours; world height record. Golden Gate Bridge Building 16 4 (1933â€“1937) â‰ˆ$450 M 2,000 Built in 4 years during the Great Depression; original cost $27 M (1937). Empire State Building Building 7 1.25 (1930â€“1931) â‰ˆ$41 M 3,000 Built in ~13.5 months; 7 million man-hours; was the tallest (381 m) until 1970. Grand Theft Auto V Video Game 6 3 (2010â€“2013) â‰ˆ$360 M 1,000 Team of ~1,000 devs; developed in 3 years; cost $265 M (dev) plus marketing. Genshin Impact Video Game 5 4 (2017â€“2020) â‰ˆ$100 M 700 Multiplayer RPG by miHoYo; initial budget ~US$100 M; team grew to ~700. Guggenheim Museum (New York) Building 4.8 3 (1956â€“1959) â‰ˆ$25 M 800 Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright; original cost $3 M (1959). The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Video Game 2.5 4 (2013â€“2017) â‰ˆ$150 M 300 Revolutionized the open-world genre; final team ~300; developed 2013â€“2017. Super Mario Odyssey Video Game 0.8 4 (2013â€“2017) â‰ˆ$100 M 100 Team of ~100; 30 million copies sold; estimated budget ~US$100 M.

I hope that after reading this post you understand why, to me, videogames are the ultimate art\u0026hellip; at least until Cyberpunk 2077\u0026rsquo;s braindance arrives.\n","permalink":"https://jesusnoseq.com/en/posts/cathedrals-and-videogames/","summary":"For some time now, I\u0026rsquo;ve been intrigued by the scant recognition that videogames receive outside the â€˜gamerâ€™ realm.

I called it Request Inbox.\nObjective I started working on this project with the goal of replacing webhookinbox.com, which was being used in the project I had just joined. Webhookinbox.com behaved quite erratically and was also very insecure. Among other things, all the URLs were public and there was no HTTPS.\nTo create a more secure and reliable application, I developed Request Inbox, and today I decided to publish the repository.\nOverview The repository is basically a monorepo that contains the entire project: frontend, backend, deployment, and pipelines. It also includes a docker-compose file to run it locally. In this case, it uses an embedded database instead of DynamoDB.\nThe backend is built with Gin (Golang) and the frontend with React. This is my first application with React, and I used V0.dev to help with the development.\nUsage To get started, simply click the \u0026ldquo;create new inbox\u0026rdquo; button and you will have an endpoint available to send and log HTTP requests.\nOnce the inbox is created, you will see which endpoint is available. Requests sent to the indicated endpoint will be logged in the application. On this page, you can enable automatic request updates and edit the response.\nFor example, you can do the following:\nAnd if you access the indicated URL, the application will log the request and send the response.\nOnce the request is received, you can conveniently inspect it.\nFeatures In addition to the main functionality, you can sign in with GitHub to have private inboxes and a list of your own inboxes.\nIt also allows dynamic responses using Golang\u0026rsquo;s template syntax, with some extra functions. You can find examples in the documentation.\nFuture I am currently working on other ideas, but I keep Request Inbox running.\nI do not rule out continuing to improve the application in the future as needs arise.\nIf you have any suggestions or ideas, you can open an issue on GitHub. I would be happy to read it.\nI hope you find the application useful ðŸ¤—\n","permalink":"https://jesusnoseq.com/en/posts/request-inbox/","summary":"Request Inbox Some time ago, I created a small project to visualize callbacks and HTTP requests.

It happens to me that I drop the project when it does not motivate me. If I already have the knowledge to complete the project and all that\u0026rsquo;s left is to spend hours on it, my motivation goes down.\nThis behavior ends up frustrating me because I want to finish projects, not leave them unfinish.\nFor this discipline is more important than motivation. And to have discipline, a set of good habits is required.\nWith the goal of creating good habits and forgetting about the bad ones, I helped myself with a few apps.\nApps I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you which ones I use and how I use them.\nThere are a lot of alternatives for all of these apps. It depends on each of you to find the one that you like and use it as it serves you best.\nLoop Habit Tracker It allows me to keep a log of my habits\u0026rsquo; fulfillment and create alarms for each one.\nThe bigger problem that I have with new habits is that I forget about them, so when I want to start one, I create new alarms.\nOnce I have used to it, I remove the alarm. I only leave notifications without sound to review at the end of the day.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important not to try to add too many new habits at once. If you can, add them one by one.\nMicrosoft To Do: Lists \u0026amp; Tasks It\u0026rsquo;s a very complete To-Do app. You could use it together with GTD for example.\nIn my case, I use it only when I have a lot of things to do and could forget some. Or when a task is too big, I break it up into a few small tasks.\nSimple Time Tracker With this app you can keep track of each thing you spend time doing.\nIt is interesting how it could be used. I only add activities that I want to spend time doing. I do not add activities about the things I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. For example; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t add an activity about mindlessly browsing the Internet. I do add activities about reading, sleeping or playing videogames.\nThe idea is trying to have the maximum time registered each day. That means that we have spent time doing what we wanted to do instead of falling into involuntary activities that make us lose time like accessing social media because we can\u0026rsquo;t register that time in the app.\n","permalink":"https://jesusnoseq.com/en/posts/time-control/","summary":"My particular case I have always been a very curious person with a tendency to start different projects.

I thought it might be a good idea to invest, I then remembered to check the fees to be paid for buying shares and discarded the option. Now it is much easier to invest and be well informed, thanks to the internet. At the beginning of 2020, I started to get interested in investing again by watching videos on YouTube. There are some really good channels, but also some that are a bit dangerous or directly looking to scam you.\nIn this post, I want to make a small introductory guide to investing with what I have been able to learn so far and what I would have liked to know much earlier.\nConcepts Compound Interest â†’ interest earned on the initial principal, as well as any accumulated interest from previous periods Central bank â†’ is a government-controlled1 institution that manages a country\u0026rsquo;s monetary policy Inflation â†’ measure the rate of increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. You can check how it has affected you Leverage â†’ use of borrowed money to increase the potential return of an investment ETF â†’ investment fund that holds assets Opportunity cost â†’ It\u0026rsquo;s the cost of the foregone opportunities Volatility â†’ variation of a financial instrument\u0026rsquo;s value over time Investing VS Gambling â†’ Spoiler, investors win over time. FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) â†’ intentional spreading of negative information to manipulate the price of an asset FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) â†’ fear of not participating in an investment opportunity Operation: buy or sell of some investment asset. For example: buy 10 shares of Microsoft. General guidelines Inflation eats your money Have a strategy DCA (Dollar Cost Average) Diversify Invest in different countries, companies, sectors, commodities, etc. There are ETFs to make this easy Don\u0026rsquo;t try to make yourself rich overnight. Fast money is always risky. Be patient. Let compound interest work for you. Before you make any big investment, be confident that you are making the right decision, and have enough conviction to not worry about it if the price goes down. Don\u0026rsquo;t go \u0026ldquo;all in\u0026rdquo; with one price. Remember DCA? Don\u0026rsquo;t try to time the market More returns mean more risk There are some operations that could have an asymmetrical risk, but think twice and be humble. Donâ€™t Over-Invest Invest only the money that you are not going to need Don\u0026rsquo;t invest all your money, keep enough in the bank to live for 6 months without any income Avoid leverage The older you are the less risk you should take The market discounts future potential events in the price. This can be a little hard to properly understand, so READ The market tends to the extremes of fear and optimism. More to read Look what they do more than what they say You can check where people like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet put their money Sometimes news is published with the intention of creating FUD or FOMO unnecessarily. Think about the interests of the person who wrote the article. Keep track of each operation that you make. You are going to need it to pay taxes. Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\nWarren Buffett\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.\nJohn Brown\nKeep learning Where to invest? There are many options for investment. Here I list the most common ones 2\nBank deposits / Interest-bearing accounts Sovereign debt Real state ETFs Company shares Comodities Crypto If you are going to invest in cryptos\u0026hellip; Know how it works and all the risks associated with it Not all crypto currencies are the same There are scams with good marketing teams Understand that projects can fail Learn how to hold your cryptos not your keys, not your coins\nWatch out for scams. Some red flags are: Returns measured in days or months Recommendations about copy trading, trading bots Safe investments with high returns Comments in social platforms and emails are infected by scams. Be careful! Some sources of information that I use Principles by Ray Dalio VisualEconomik I have a few more sources in the Spanish post, but the audio is, of course, in Spanish.\nI would like to add I\u0026rsquo;m not a professional investor or anything similar.
