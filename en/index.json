[{"content":"When I started working and saving some money. I thought it might be a good idea to invest, I then remembered to check the fees to be paid for buying shares and discarded the option. Now it is much easier to invest and be well informed, thanks to the internet. At the beginning of 2020, I started to get interested in investing again by watching videos on YouTube. There are some really good channels, but also some that are a bit dangerous or directly looking to scam you.\nIn this post, I want to make a small introductory guide to investing with what I have been able to learn so far and what I would have liked to know much earlier.\nConcepts Compound Interest → interest earned on the initial principal, as well as any accumulated interest from previous periods Central bank → is a government-controlled1 institution that manages a country\u0026rsquo;s monetary policy Inflation → measure the rate of increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. You can check how it has affected you Leverage → use of borrowed money to increase the potential return of an investment ETF → investment fund that holds assets Opportunity cost → It\u0026rsquo;s the cost of the foregone opportunities Volatility → variation of a financial instrument\u0026rsquo;s value over time Investing VS Gambling → Spoiler, investors win over time. FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) → intentional spreading of negative information to manipulate the price of an asset FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) → fear of not participating in an investment opportunity Operation: buy or sell of some investment asset. For example: buy 10 shares of Microsoft. General guidelines Inflation eats your money Have a strategy DCA (Dollar Cost Average) Diversify Invest in different countries, companies, sectors, commodities, etc. There are ETFs to make this easy Don\u0026rsquo;t try to make yourself rich overnight. Fast money is always risky. Be patient. Let compound interest work for you. Before you make any big investment, be confident that you are making the right decision, and have enough conviction to not worry about it if the price goes down. Don\u0026rsquo;t go \u0026ldquo;all in\u0026rdquo; with one price. Remember DCA? Don\u0026rsquo;t try to time the market More returns mean more risk There are some operations that could have an asymmetrical risk, but think twice and be humble. Don’t Over-Invest Invest only the money that you are not going to need Don\u0026rsquo;t invest all your money, keep enough in the bank to live for 6 months without any income Avoid leverage The older you are the less risk you should take The market discounts future potential events in the price. This can be a little hard to properly understand, so READ The market tends to the extremes of fear and optimism. More to read Look what they do more than what they say You can check where people like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet put their money Sometimes news is published with the intention of creating FUD or FOMO unnecessarily. Think about the interests of the person who wrote the article. Keep track of each operation that you make. You are going to need it to pay taxes. Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\nWarren Buffett\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.\nJohn Brown\nKeep learning Where to invest? There are many options for investment. Here I list the most common ones 2\nBank deposits / Interest-bearing accounts Sovereign debt Real state ETFs Company shares Comodities Crypto If you are going to invest in cryptos\u0026hellip; Know how it works and all the risks associated with it Not all crypto currencies are the same There are scams with good marketing teams Understand that projects can fail Learn how to hold your cryptos not your keys, not your coins\nWatch out for scams. Some red flags are: Returns measured in days or months Recommendations about copy trading, trading bots Safe investments with high returns Comments in social platforms and emails are infected by scams. Be careful! Some sources of information that I use Principles by Ray Dalio VisualEconomik I have a few more sources in the Spanish post, but the audio is, of course, in Spanish.\nI would like to add I\u0026rsquo;m not a professional investor or anything similar. I believe, I can contribute by explaining basic concepts in a simple way, and help people become more aware of how money works to protect their savings.\nDepends on the country this could be true or less true.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThere is a lot of variety in company shares, ETFs, cryptos, etc. I tried to order the list from less to more risky, but that\u0026rsquo;s impossible because, for example, some company shares, called \u0026ldquo;penny stocks\u0026rdquo;, could be a lot riskier than any commodity, or sovereign debt of a country with very high inflation is riskier than the main cryptocurrency (BTC).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://jesusnoseq.com/en/posts/investment/","summary":"When I started working and saving some money.

It happens to me that I drop the project when it does not motivate me. If I already have the knowledge to complete the project and all that\u0026rsquo;s left is to spend hours on it, my motivation goes down.\nThis behavior ends up frustrating me because I want to finish projects, not leave them forgotten.\nFor this more than motivation what is needed is discipline. And to have discipline, a set of good habits is required.\nWith the goal of creating good habits and forgetting about the bad ones, I helped myself with a few apps.\nApps I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you which ones I use and how I use them.\nThere are a lot of alternatives for all of these apps. It depends on each of you to find the one that you like and use it as it serves you best.\nLoop Habit Tracker It allows me to keep a log of my habits\u0026rsquo; fulfillment and create alarms for each one.\nThe bigger problem that I have with new habits is that I forget about them, so when I want to start one, I create new alarms.\nOnce I have it incorporated, I remove the alarm. I only left notifications without sound to review at the end of the day.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to not try to add too many new habits at once. If you can, add them one by one.\nMicrosoft To Do: Lists \u0026amp; Tasks It\u0026rsquo;s a very complete TODO app. You could use it together with GTD for example.\nIn my case, I use it only when I have a lot of things to do and could forget some. Or when a task is too big, I break it up into a few small tasks.\nSimple Time Tracker With this app you can keep track of each thing you spend time doing.\nIt is interesting how it could be used. I only add activities that I want to spend time doing. I do not add activities about the things I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. For example; I didn\u0026rsquo;t add an activity about mindlessly browsing the Internet. I do add activities about reading, sleeping or playing videogames.\nThe idea is trying to have the maximum time registered each day. That means that we spent time doing what we wanted to do instead of falling into involuntary activities that make us lose time like accessing social media because we can\u0026rsquo;t register that time in the app.\n","permalink":"https://jesusnoseq.com/en/posts/time-control/","summary":"My particular case I have always been a very curious person with a tendency to start different projects.
