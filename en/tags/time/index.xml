      <description>My particular case I have always been a very curious person with a tendency to start different projects. It happens to me that I drop the project when it does not motivate me. If I already have the knowledge to complete the project and all that&amp;rsquo;s left is to spend hours on it, my motivation goes down.
This behavior ends up frustrating me because I want to finish projects, not leave them unfinish.</description>
