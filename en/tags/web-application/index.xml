      <description>Request Inbox Some time ago, I created a small project to visualize callbacks and HTTP requests. I called it Request Inbox.
Objective I started working on this project with the goal of replacing webhookinbox.com, which was being used in the project I had just joined. Webhookinbox.com behaved quite erratically and was also very insecure. Among other things, all the URLs were public and there was no HTTPS.
To create a more secure and reliable application, I developed Request Inbox, and today I decided to publish the repository.</description>
